# Fundamentals of Python for H&H Modeling and Analysis

A practical Python course for water resources engineers.

---

## About

This course teaches Python programming fundamentals through real hydrologic and hydraulic engineering workflows. It is designed for water resources professionals who already understand H&H concepts but want practical, usable Python skills without becoming software engineers.

Instead of abstract coding exercises, the course focuses on real tasks engineers deal with every day: working with time series, spatial vector and raster data, stream and gage data, and precipitation datasets. The emphasis is on writing clear, readable code and using Python to replace spreadsheets, automate repetitive tasks, and build reproducible analyses.

The course also recognizes that AI and large language models have fundamentally changed how engineers write, read, and understand code. Rather than ignoring these tools, the course shows how to use them responsibly and effectively to accelerate learning, explore unfamiliar libraries, debug workflows, and improve code quality—while still maintaining engineering judgment and accountability.

By the end of the course, you will feel comfortable using Python and modern AI-assisted workflows as everyday tools to support hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, data analysis, and decision-making in real-world engineering practice.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

If you would like to add a lesson, improve an existing notebook, or fix issues, please use the structure and clarity demonstrated in the following contribution guidlines.
### Contribution Guidelines

Each contributed lesson notebook should include the following sections at the top:

1. **Lesson Level**  
   Clearly state the level of the lesson (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

2. **Purpose**  
   A short paragraph explaining why this lesson exists and where it fits in the course.

3. **Learning Objectives**  
   A concise bullet list describing what learners should be able to do by the end of the lesson.

4. **Prerequisites (if any)**  
   Reference prior modules or skills assumed.

5. **Clear, applied examples**  
   Lessons should focus on practical H&H-relevant workflows, not abstract programming exercises.

### General Expectations

- Keep code readable and well commented
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Use real-world hydrology and hydraulics examples when possible
- Use AI prompts and demonstrate how it was used or should be used.
- Assume learners are engineers, not software developers

If you are unsure whether a contribution is a good fit, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion first.
