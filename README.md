## 📖 About

This course teaches Python programming fundamentals through **real hydrologic and hydraulic engineering workflows**. It is designed for water resources professionals who already understand H&H concepts but want practical, usable Python skills without becoming software engineers.

### 🎯 What Makes This Course Different

**Real-World Focus**  
Instead of abstract coding exercises, the course focuses on real tasks engineers deal with every day: working with time series, spatial vector and raster data, stream and gage data, and precipitation datasets.

**Clarity Over Complexity**  
The emphasis is on writing clear, readable code and using Python to replace spreadsheets, automate repetitive tasks, and build reproducible analyses.

**AI-Enhanced Learning**  
The course recognizes that AI and large language models have fundamentally changed how engineers write, read, and understand code. Rather than ignoring these tools, the course shows how to use them responsibly and effectively to accelerate learning, explore unfamiliar libraries, debug workflows, and improve code quality—while still maintaining engineering judgment and accountability.

### 🎓 What You'll Learn

By the end of the course, you will feel comfortable using Python and modern AI-assisted workflows as everyday tools to support hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, data analysis, and decision-making in real-world engineering practice.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! We believe in the power of community-driven learning.

If you would like to add a lesson, improve an existing notebook, or fix issues, please use the structure and clarity demonstrated in the contribution guidelines below.

### 📋 Contribution Guidelines

Each contributed lesson notebook should include the following sections at the top:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>1️⃣ Lesson Level</strong></td>
    <td>Clearly state the level of the lesson (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>2️⃣ Purpose</strong></td>
    <td>A short paragraph explaining why this lesson exists and where it fits in the course</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>3️⃣ Learning Objectives</strong></td>
    <td>A concise bullet list describing what learners should be able to do by the end of the lesson</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>4️⃣ Prerequisites</strong></td>
    <td>Reference prior modules or skills assumed (if any)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>5️⃣ Clear Examples</strong></td>
    <td>Lessons should focus on practical H&H-relevant workflows, not abstract programming exercises</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### ✨ General Expectations

- ✅ Keep code readable and well commented
- ✅ Prefer clarity over cleverness
- ✅ Use real-world hydrology and hydraulics examples when possible
- ✅ Use AI prompts and demonstrate how it was used or should be used
- ✅ Assume learners are engineers, not software developers

> 💡 **Tip:** If you are unsure whether a contribution is a good fit, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion first.
