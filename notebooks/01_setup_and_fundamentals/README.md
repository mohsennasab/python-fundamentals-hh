# Module 1: Setup and Fundamentals

## Overview

This module introduces Python to hydrologic and hydraulic (H&H) professionals. The focus is on building the right mental models before writing code, using familiar engineering concepts as a foundation.

## Lessons

**Lesson 1: Introduction and Setup**
- Setting up Google Colab as your Python workspace
- Understanding Python through H&H analogies (variables as named cells, functions as calculation templates)
- Using AI assistants to explain, debug, and generate code
- Running your first H&H calculations

**Lesson 2: Python Fundamentals**
- Making decisions with if statements (flood stage checks, capacity evaluations)
- Automating repetitive tasks with for loops
- Creating reusable functions for common calculations
- Reading and writing Excel files

## Prerequisites

- Google account (for Colab access)
- Basic familiarity with Excel
- No prior programming experience required

## Getting Started

1. Open the notebooks in Google Colab
2. Work through each lesson sequentially
3. Run the code cells and complete the exercises
4. Use the AI prompt templates provided when you need help

## Key Takeaways

- Python scripts are written workflows that automate your existing processes
- Errors are feedback, not failure
- You do not need to memorize syntax; focus on understanding concepts
- AI tools are professional resources for learning and problem-solving
