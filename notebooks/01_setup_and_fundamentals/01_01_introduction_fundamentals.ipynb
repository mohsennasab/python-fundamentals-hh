    "### Python Is Tools You Already Know, Combined\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Python as:\n",
    "- **A powerful calculator** (like your HP or Casio)\n",
    "- **A spreadsheet** (like Excel)\n",
    "- **A data table** (like GIS attribute tables)\n",
    "- **A plotting tool** (like Excel charts or HEC-RAS plots)\n",
    "- **An automation system** (like Model Builder or macros)\n",
    "\n",
    "All in one place, all talking to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Script Is Just a Written Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "When you manually:\n",
    "1. Import gauge data\n",
    "2. Calculate statistics\n",
    "3. Apply rating curve\n",
    "4. Plot hydrograph\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script just writes these steps down so they run automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Familiar Concepts, New Names\n",
    "\n",
    "| What You Know | What Python Calls It | Example |\n",
    "|---------------|---------------------|----------|\n",
    "| Named cell in Excel (B2=\"Peak_Flow\") | Variable | `peak_flow = 1250` |\n",
    "| Column of data | List | `rainfall = [2.1, 3.4, 1.8, 4.2]` |\n",
    "| Lookup table | Dictionary | `manning_n = {'concrete': 0.012, 'earth': 0.025}` |\n",
    "| Calculation template | Function | `def calculate_discharge(area, velocity):` |\n",
    "| IF statement in Excel | Conditional | `if stage > flood_stage:` |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors Are Feedback, Not Failure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical mindset shift:**\n",
    "- In Excel, an error means something broke\n",
    "- In Python, an error is the computer asking for clarification\n",
    "- Every experienced programmer sees errors every day\n",
    "- Errors tell you exactly what to fix\n",

    "### You Don't Need to Memorize Anything\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike exams, in real Python work you can always:\n",
    "- Google syntax\n",
    "- Ask AI for help\n",
    "- Copy from previous scripts\n",
